On a Linux machine you can simply run the precompiled executable "./api_server"
This will create a database file and start the api_server on port 0.0.0.0:8000


If you are using MacOS or windows, then you'll have to compile "api_server" yourself,

 - Install Golang on your machine
 - cd into the api_serfver directory
 - bash> go get .
 - bash> go run .
